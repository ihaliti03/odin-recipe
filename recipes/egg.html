    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Now you might think that this is some BS. Why would anyone give egg recipe?!</p>
    <p>However, little did you know. Eggs are very high in protein and very crucial to grow muscles (13g of protein per egg, jim rats love it).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> of course</li>
        <li><em>Oil</em></li>
        <li><strong><em>Vegetta</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the pan on the fire</li>
        <li>Put some oil and wait for it to heat</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs and put them on the pan</li>
        <li>Little bit of vegetta from the top makes it tasty</li>
        <li>Wait for it to cook and to look nice</li>
    </ol>
